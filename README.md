# Level Ground
A nonprofit website layout for Level Ground, built with HTML/CSS from a professional mockup. Highlights include a clear message, impact sections, and a contact area—designed to communicate mission and drive user engagement.

## How It's Made:

When I started this project, I first wrote out the base structure of the code just to get everything on the page. My goal at that stage wasn’t styling—it was simply laying down the foundation I would refine later. Once the structure was in place, I noticed that the website naturally broke into five main sections, so I used that as the roadmap for how I approached the layout and styling.

At the time, I was working heavily with floats, and I could immediately identify which parts of the layout needed them. The first section included the navigation bar, which I organized using floats to align the elements neatly across the top. After that, I positioned the rest of the elements normally and styled them using padding, margins, and spacing to keep everything clean and readable.

The second section—the “Why” section—was much more straightforward. I focused on strong spacing, proper padding, and a clean layout to make the content easy to process.

The third section was easily the second most challenging part of the project. Both of the “visit options” columns shared the exact same structure, so I grouped each one into sections using the same class to avoid repeating code. After that, I reused and adjusted the button styling from the navigation area, scaling the measurements to make the buttons more prominent. Once the content for both columns was finalized, I floated them side by side to mirror the design of the mockup.

The fourth section closely mirrored the “Why” section, but this time it included a button meant to redirect the user to a page with volunteer opportunities. I reused the same structural framework from the earlier section and integrated the button so the section stayed visually consistent with the rest of the design.

The fifth section was, without a doubt, the hardest. It involved multiple subsections, each of which required precise float usage to match the mockup exactly. Once I understood how each piece fit together, everything started to click into place. After completing the layout, I chose a strong, bold font that captured the feeling and energy I wanted the site to have—unique, eye-catching, and full of presence.

## Optimizations
One small visual change I made was adding white edges along the sides of the screen. It’s subtle, but it gives the website a more modern, sleek feel, and makes the layout easier on the eyes. It also helps set the site apart and makes the design feel more intentional.

The bottom section with the social media links originally threw me off. It didn’t make sense visually until I shifted my perspective and started viewing everything as boxes when working with floats. Once I did that, everything finally clicked—the entire layout became more intuitive. Understanding floats as a system of boxes made the whole structure fall into place and gave me a much clearer sense of control over the design.

## Lessons Learned:
Through this project, I learned the importance of establishing the structure of a website before worrying about design. Getting the foundation in place first—how each section is laid out, how the content flows, and how everything connects—makes the rest of the process much smoother. Once the structure is solid, I can shift my focus to the aesthetics and styling without feeling overwhelmed. Breaking the work into phases like this helps me pace myself and ultimately saves time.

I also gained a much deeper understanding of floats. Mastering them took repetition, but the more I worked with floats, the more the patterns began to make sense. By the time I reached the fifth section, everything finally clicked: floats are essentially about treating each element like a box and applying the right spacing and math to position them correctly. That realization brought everything full circle and made the entire layout process much more intuitive.
